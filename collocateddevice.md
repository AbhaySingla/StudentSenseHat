### Humber Raspberry Pi Image Creation

Building the Humber image for the Sense Hat:

1.  Format an at least class 10 minimum of 8GB SD card with:
    <https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html> 

2.  Use <http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/> to write the
    following image once unzipped on to the card:
	http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2017-04-10/2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie.zip

3.  Alternatively you can use copy the contents of
    https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/NOOBS/images/NOOBS-2017-04-10/NOOBS_v2_4_0.zip
    to the card which, after the first boot, has a similar result to the above
    step.

4.  Change internationalization options to the 104 key US keyboard by opening a terminal and using the command
    sudo raspi-config

5.  Once you have connected to the internet via wired ethernet or Wi-Fi also use the terminal:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/ceng317/master/firmware/hshrackv01.sh
chmod u+x hshrackv01.sh
./hshrackv01.sh

1. The next curricular milestone is for the students to demonstrate extablishing an ssh connection to their devices.
2. Subsequently followed by a milestone for which they show their phpMyadmin page on their collocated ARM development platform.
