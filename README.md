# CENG 317
##### 2017-2018 Capstone Project Overview:
- In CENG 319 Software Project students will work in groups to create an Android Application that can connect to a database.
- In CENG 317 Hardware Production Technology students will work individually to prepare working hardware that can connect to a database for a sensor or effector type relevant to their Android application.
- In CENG 355 Computer Systems Project students work in groups to integrate their mobile application with their sensors and effectors to create an IoT device that for which both it and its application can indepedently connect to the same database. (The mobile application may, in addition, also connect directly via bluetooth to the IoT device.) 
- Regarding CENG 317 Hardware Production Technology, a Broadcom development platform will be used by each student who will connect a sensor or effector unit to it. The goal is to scale the hardware to include multiple units and package it to fit in a suitable enclosure that fits within the overall project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x 7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.
