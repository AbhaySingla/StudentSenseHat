# ceng317
2017-2018 Capstone Project Overview:
In CENG 319 Software Project students will work in groups to create an Android Application.
In CENG 317 Hardware Production Technology students will work individually to prepare working hardware for a sensor or effector type relevant to their Android application.
In CENG 355 Computer Systems Project students work in groups to integrate their mobile application with their sensors and effectors to create an IoT device. 
Regarding CENG 317 Hardware Production Technology, a Broadcom development platform will be used by each student who will connect a sensor or effector unit to it. The goal is to scale the hardware to include multiple units and package it to fit can be connected work individually to prepare working hardware for a sensor or effector
